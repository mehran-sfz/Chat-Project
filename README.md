# Django REST Framework Chat Application

This project is a chat application built with Django REST Framework, designed for real-time messaging between users. It leverages WebSocket for instant chat updates and JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and authorization. The project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Built with WebSocket support for instant message delivery.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for robust user authentication and authorization.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy setup and scalability with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Predefined API Requests**: API requests are organized in a Postman collection for testing convenience.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

## Getting Started

- `chat_project/Postman/`

You can import this collection into Postman to easily explore and test all available endpoints.
